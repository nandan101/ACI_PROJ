This section describes the methodology and the dataset, The study proposes a text generation system leveraging GPT-2, a transformer-based model. The method involves training the model on domain-specific datasets and fine-tuning it for enhanced control over text attributes such as sentiment, formality, fluency, and toxicity. The architecture incorporates attention mechanisms, autoregressive decoding, and optimization strategies to generate high-quality text outputs.
